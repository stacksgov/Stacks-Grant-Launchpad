# Stacks Foundation Legacy Grants Program (Archived)

This repository is maintained for archive purposes only. It contains historical grant applications and discussions from our previous open grants process.

## Important Note

The Stacks Foundation no longer accepts open grant applications on a rolling basis. However, it's worth noting that the previous incarnation of the grants program was incredibly vibrant and experimental in nature, fostering significant innovation within the Stacks ecosystem.

As our ecosystem matured, we recognized that the grants program would be better served by splitting into two distinct programs:

1. [Critical Bounties Program](https://github.com/stacksfoundation/critical-bounties): Led by the Stacks Foundation, this program allows for targeted, high-impact infrastructure and tooling development via an RFP-style process.

2. [DeGrants Program](https://github.com/stacksgov/decentralized-grants): A community-led grants program where funding priorities are completely determined by the community and DeGrants Stewards.

This evolution allows us to balance focused development of critical infrastructure with continued support for diverse, community-driven innovations.

Feel free to browse the [Issues](../../issues) to see past grant applications and discussions, which showcase the breadth and depth of ideas that have contributed to the Stacks ecosystem.
