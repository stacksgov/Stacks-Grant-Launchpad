## Introduction

The Stacks Open Internet Foundation (also known as the Stacks Foundation) is committed to promoting a user-owned internet by supporting developers, designers, and founders through our RFP-style grant program called Critical Bounties. Working closely with core contributors to the Bitcoin L2, program leads at the Stacks Foundation identify needs that can be best addressed by the broader community. These needs are then scoped into RFPs, which we call Critical Bounties. Whether tightly or loosely-scoped, Critical Bounties prioritize strong technical projects that immediately add widespread value to the Stacks ecosystem and help make Bitcoin a more active asset. We encourage passionate individuals interested in advancing the mission of activating all L1 Bitcoin-based assets on the L2 Stacks layer to submit their project proposals.

## How To Apply

1. Critical Bounties are typically posted once per quarter and applications remain open for about a month.
- You can sign-up here if you would like to be notified when new Critical Bounties are made available.
2. Active Critical Bounties can be found on the Foundation website [here](https://grants.stacks.org) or on the Grants Repo [here](https://github.com/stacksgov/Stacks-Grant-Launchpad/issues).
3. Once youâ€™ve identified a Critical Bounty you would like to apply for,  follow the link within the GitHub Issue and fill out the linked form.
4. After applications have closed and our review is complete, Critical Bounty recipients will be notified via the comment section below the GitHub Issue.
