## 4.  Procedure

To apply for the Stacks Open Internet Grants Program, your application shall fulfill the following criteria:

- All projects shall be a software-based projects, which contributes to the advancement of the Stacks ecosystem;

- the total amount of funding requested for the project shall be below USD $25,000 and USD $250,000 for follow-up grants at the time of submission;

- the Software shall be released under the Apache license version 2.0.;

- You must accept payment in the blockchain tokens native to the Stacks Network ("STXs");

- You will need to submit the application and deliver the milestones according to the process specified below;

The open grants process consists of five parts, each of them described in more detail below:

- Application Review Phase: This phase consists of the following steps:
Submit an application via the [Stacks Foundation Projects Launchpad](https://grants.stacks.org/). 
The Project Launchpad creates a Github issue for your project application.
After creating your application all interaction, revisions, updates occur on Github.
Receive informal feedback received from the community on your application via comments on your Github issue.
Revise your application based on the feedback you receive.
Wait for the formal review and determinations for your funding round to be announced.

- Onboarding Phase: The Onboarding Phase consists of the following steps:
  - Project Lead verifies identity using a third-party KYC service.
  - Project Lead (aka applicant) signs contract and a representative from the Stacks Foundation countersigns contract.
  - Initial Payment disbursed at the conclusion of the Onboarding Phase.
  - Begin work on your project.

- Milestone Deliverable Phase:

Depending on the size of your project budget you may either skip this step, or repeat it several times (see this [chart] for details), but in general, a Milestone Phase consists of:

  - Post a link to the completed work and request a review by completing the correct milestone issue (affiliated with the Grant issue) on Github..  
  - Allow the Stacks community an opportunity to review and comment on your work verifying it is done as outlined in the project application.  
  - Once it is determined the work matches the approved project application your Milestone Payment will be disbursed. 

- Final Deliverable Phase: The Final Deliverable Phase works just like a Milestone Phase. At the conclusion of this phase, you will be awarded your final payment.

### Stale Designation

Once a project initiates and the grant is initially approved, a participant needs to formally submit an update in the form of a deliverable on GitHub within the first 30 days, if not, the project will be marked as "stale". Additionally, once a progress milestone is approved, a participant needs to formally submit an update in the form of a deliverable on GitHub within 30 days, if not, the project will be marked as "stale".
Clawback:
If a grant is marked 'Stale' and is not updated within 30 days, the grant will be 'Closed'.  You will be required to reapply to complete any previously approved work and You shall be responsible for paying back any prior funds paid to you for that grant if the work is left in a state where either the scope of work completed does not conform to the milestones outlined in your application, as determined in the sole discretion of the Foundation, and/or not delivered to the milestone delivery guidelines outlined in the Terms.

## 16. Dispute Resolution; Arbitration
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT CONTAINS ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE ONLY TO INDIVIDUALS LOCATED, RESIDENT, OR DOMICILED IN THE UNITED STATES. IF YOU ARE LOCATED, RESIDENT, OR DOMICILED IN THE UNITED STATES, THIS SECTION REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH THE FOUNDATION AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.
Binding Arbitration. Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, “Disputes”) in which either Party seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and the Foundation (i) waive your and the Foundation’s respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to these Grant Terms resolved in a court, and (ii) waive your and the Foundation’s respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and the Foundation will arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).
No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions. Any Dispute arising out of or related to these Grant Terms is personal to you and the Foundation and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.
Federal Arbitration Act. These Grant Terms affect interstate commerce and the enforceability of this Section 12 will be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution. Each Party will notify the other Party in writing of any Dispute within 30 days of the date it arises, so that the Parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to the Foundation shall be sent by e-mail to the Foundation at grants@stacks.org. We may provide notice to you via email to the email address you provide us in connection with Registration. Your notice must include (i) your name, postal address, email address and telephone number, (ii) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (iii) the specific relief that you are seeking. If you and the Foundation cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within 30 days after the date notice is received by the applicable Party, then either you or the Foundation may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section 12, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in Section 12(a), file a claim in court.
Any arbitration will occur in San Francisco County, California. Arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”), which are hereby incorporated by reference. The state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California will have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. You may also litigate a Dispute in the small claims court located in the county where you reside if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.
Authority of Arbitrator. As limited by the FAA, these Grant Terms and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have (i) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (ii) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Grant Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.
Rules of JAMS. The rules of JAMS and additional information about JAMS are available on the JAMS website. By agreeing to be bound by these Grant Terms, you either (i) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS, or (ii) waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.
Severability of Dispute Resolution; Arbitration. If any term, clause or provision of this Section 12 is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this Section 12 will remain valid and enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth in Section 12 are severable from the other provisions of these Grant Terms and will remain valid and enforceable, except as prohibited by applicable law.
